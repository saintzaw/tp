## Project: Modganiser

Modganiser is a module planner that is focused on helping Information Security Undergraduates graduate in 4 years. 
It does so by giving them a platform to plan all 4 years of their modules to aid in meeting their graduation 
requirements on time. Modganiser works via the Command Line Interface (CLI), which is much more efficient for fast 
typists.

The following sections include the contributions that I have made to the project.
